# RegExp in Elm

**Generally speaking, it will be easier and nicer to use a real parsing library like [elm-tools/parser][elm].**

That said, sometimes you may want the hacky kind of regular expressions that appear in JavaScript. Maybe you found some [`RegExp`][js] on StackOverflow and just want to place it in your code directly. This library reluctantly supports that scenario.
